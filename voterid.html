    <h2>Role of the Commission</h2>
    <p>The Election Commission is a permanent and independent body established by the Constitution of India to ensure free and fair elections across the country. According to Article 324 of the Constitution, it is responsible for the superintendence, direction, and control of elections for the Parliament, state legislatures, and the offices of the President and Vice-President of India. As a result, the Election Commission operates as a national body, serving both the central and state governments. However, itâ€™s important to note that the Election Commission does not handle elections for panchayats and municipalities; for these, the Constitution establishes a separate State Election Commission.
